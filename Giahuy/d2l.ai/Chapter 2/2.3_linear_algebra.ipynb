There is a lot more to linear algebra, though, and much of it is useful for machine learning. For example, matrices can be decomposed into factors, and these decompositions can reveal low-dimensional structure in real-world datasets. There are entire subfields of machine learning that focus on using matrix decompositions and their generalizations to high-order tensors to discover structure in datasets and solve prediction problems. But this book focuses on deep learning. And we believe you will be more inclined to learn more mathematics once you have gotten your hands dirty applying machine learning to real datasets. So while we reserve the right to introduce more mathematics later on, we wrap up this section here.\n",

        "* Elementwise products are called Hadamard products. By contrast, dot products, matrix--vector products, and matrix--matrix products are not elementwise operations and in general return objects having shapes that are different from the the operands.\n",
        "* Compared to Hadamard products, matrix--matrix products take considerably longer to compute (cubic rather than quadratic time).\n",
        "* Norms capture various notions of the magnitude of a vector (or matrix), and are commonly applied to the difference of two vectors to measure their distance apart.\n",
